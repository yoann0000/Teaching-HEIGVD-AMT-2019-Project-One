# Bugs, Limitations and Improvements

## Bugs

None so far, only features.

## Limitations

the quest database needs to be populated before use.

## Improvements

Given time constraints and our overall knowledge of java EE and the MVC model many of our intended features never made it into the final version. With more time here are a few of the Improvements we would make to the application.

- Make races and classes be more that just flavour text.
- Have quest be more complex than just "push button to quest".
- Have quests with stat of level requirements or be better suited to some roles.
- Have users be able to create quests.
- Have stronger differentiation between parties and guilds
