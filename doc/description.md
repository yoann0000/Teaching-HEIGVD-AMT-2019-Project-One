# Project Description

Our project allows you to create a character based on the popular role playing game **Dungeons & Dragons**.
You can create a character from the registration page or, if you already have one you can simply login with your character name and password.

## Navbar

At the top of each page the user will find a navigation bar allowing him to traverse the four pages of our application or logout if he desires.

## Home screen

Once you have logged in with a character, You fill see your character sheet.
This sheet contains your character's stats, his gold and his experience.
Under that you will also find the guild and party sections.

If the user has had enough of this mediocre application he can find the most important button at the bottom of the page *\"Delete my account\"*.

## Guilds

A guild is a communal entity that offers quests to parties of adventurers.
* A user can join a guild or create his own
* A user can only be part of one guild at a time
* Before joining a guild a user can look at it's profile (name, reputation, members, etc)
* Being part of a guild gives the user access to the quest tab

## Parties

A party is a communal entity that allows users to take on quests from their guilds.
* A user can join a party or create his own
* A user can join as many parties as he wants
* A party is usually smaller than a guild

## Gold

Gold is the currency of our system but, as of this writing, serves no other purpose than bragging rights.

## Experience

Experience is awarded to an adventurer upon completing quests.
Upon accumulating a certain amount the adventurer gains a level.

## Level

An adventurer's level shows how good an adventurer he is since the level is directly related to the amount of quests he has finished. When a character gains a level he gains 2 stat points.

## Stat Points

There are six different stats
* strength
* dexterity
* constitution
* intelligence
* wisdom
* charisma

The number attributed to the stat shows how proficient he is with it and how well he will perform when doing tasks related to that stat.
